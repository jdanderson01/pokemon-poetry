            <p>
                slavery is a state of being <br />
                present in the past, current, and future <br />
                an eternal chain wrapped around our culture <br />
                from the ships to the media <br />
                slavery is always changing form <br />
                whips cracking through the air <br />
                to the absence of a phone leaving us bare <br />
                physical scars transition to mental <br />
                the damage eventually settling as spiritual <br />
                generations removed and still scarred <br />
                slavery is said to tear us apart <br />
                but today slavery brings us together <br />
                today slavery tells us the weather <br />
                modern slavery tells you what’s better <br />
                in hopes that you follow the shepherd <br />
                slavery isn’t forced upon us anymore <br />
                slavery is a choice agreed upon by the horde <br />
                slavery isn’t oppression <br />
                slavery is accepted impression

            <p>
                darkness is said to be the absence of light <br />
                a state of being ruled by fright <br />
                the lack of fire that fuels fright <br />
                darkness is a chilling embrace <br />
                a runner always at the front of the race <br />
                a creature with more than one face <br />
                the stalker in the night that makes you brace <br />
                but only lingers briefly for a small taste <br />
                darkness is one half of the puzzle <br />
                with the other half being its muzzle <br />
                a dam to stop the roaring water <br />
                the soldier that holds the border <br />
                light is the companion of darkness <br />
                split in two inside our conscious <br />
                yet always melding together <br />
                both are powers we harness <br />
                to make choices in stormy weather <br />

            <p>
                flowers are depicted as art <br />
                things to appreciate without knowledge <br />
                only known to bloom and wilt <br />
                and when they do, with a tilt <br />
                but nothing more than the surface <br />
                on which they grow on <br />
                sometimes at the edge of a pond <br />
                flowers are heralds of change <br />
                at the end of a period of doom <br />
                the sign of peace is a flower’s bloom <br />
                the warrior that slays the beast <br />
                known as gloom <br />
                an embodiment of the rainbow <br />
                flowers often symbolize one’s hope <br />
                a friend that consoles you <br />
                and makes you forget about the rope <br />
                flowers grow just like humans do <br />
                a flower is present in me and you <br />
                it’s our choice to nurture it <br />
                and plant the seeds before we wilt <br />

                rain is the pretext <br />

                a signal of new times <br />
                one without destruction <br />
                a fuel for construction <br />
                one drop at a time <br />
                the sound a backdrop <br />
                through the annals of history <br />
                powering germination <br />
                and leading to civilization <br />
                a slow but steady tide <br />
                continuously flowing from the sky <br />
                a reminder of mankind’s pride <br />
                and that there is nowhere to hide <br />

                a stop in life is always seen as a negative <br />

                a road block to one’s destination <br />
                but a day for rest was cast down <br />
                a pause in life <br />
                a brief reprieve from the constant strife <br />
                time dedicated to treat the body how it should <br />
                not to continue working the hood <br />
                brandishing words in the shape of a knife <br />
                leaving tracks the shape of a paw <br />
                ravenous hunger taking the shape of a maw <br />
                a simple pause would be nice <br />
                and relieve us of our vice <br />

                it’s present in our every feature <br />
                like the steam that powered trains <br />
                love is like the fuel for our brain <br />
                love is also responsible for pain <br />
                leaving you to wonder in the rain <br />
                the lack of it makes you empty <br />
                a husky of what you once were <br />
                like old machinery in a junk yard <br />
                love can tear you apart <br />
                but build you once more <br />
                love is a revolving door <br />

                armor is like a shell <br />
                often physical, but spiritual as well <br />
                protecting from the influences of hell <br />
                denizens ill when you’re well <br />
                armor was made for a purpose <br />
                to shield the body during battle <br />
                but not the mind after <br />
                foes lingering in the minds’ rafters <br />

                beauty is ethereal, intangible <br />

                we search for beauty and often find it <br />
                just to realize that we end up craving more <br />
                the hunger like a ravenous horde <br />
                beauty is frightening <br />
                present then gone like lightning <br />
                one day you have it <br />

                light is perceived as a beam <br />

                minister of truth under a hopeful roof <br />
                but also a beacon during times of stress <br />
                the deacon that wakes you from your rest <br />
                it shines on everyone, you and me <br />

                many crave the touch but fall short <br />
                and as a retort <br />
                they deny light and its providence <br />
                allowing darkness to seep within their countenance <br />
